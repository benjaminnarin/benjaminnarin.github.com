											&emsp;(Lost) In the Woods is a multidisciplinary, interactive animated installation created by visual artist Shelley Jordon in collaboration with musician/composer Kurt Rohde.\
										</p>\
										<p>\
											&emsp;This project explores the experience of being “lost” in the woods from the perspective of emotion, metaphor and the psychological. Spanning&nbsp;\
											three galleries, the installations combine hand-painted animations, 2-D&nbsp;artwork, and live-action videos with original music and&nbsp;sound.&nbsp;\
											The paintings are activated with projected animations and sounds as people walk to specific points in the installation. Additional animations appear in unexpected places,\
											comprised of chance images accompanied by sound and music.\
										</p>\
										<p>\
											&emsp;The project is a unique collaboration between robotocists from Oregon State University\'s Personal Robotics Lab (Bill Smart and Benjamin Narin) and Visual artist\
											Shelley Jordon and sound artist Kurt Rohde. It brings together engineering and art to creat an immersive interactive experience that is unique to each viewer.\
