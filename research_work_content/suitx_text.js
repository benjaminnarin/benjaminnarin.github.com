		&emsp;SuitX is a startup company working on medical and industrial Exoskeletons. \
		The company was created out of Homayoon Kazerooni\'s lab at UC Berkeley.\
		<p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;While competing in the Robotics For Good Competition in Dubai, with the\
		wheelchair project, I met several members of suitX another team competing\
		After getting to know the suitX team over the course of the competition they\
		offered me a summer internship, thus I spent the summer in Berkeley\. Over the\
		four months I was at suitX I had the chance to work with their medical, industrial\
		and marketing teams.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;As a part of their Medical Exo Team I\
		updated, modified or designed all thirteen boards on the suit, resulting in\
		a new run of PCBs and a new Exo Suit Revision. I also unified the\
		electrical parts library, established design standards and practices and added\
		revision control.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;I assisted the Industrial Engineering Team review \
		and update electrical designs going into production. I also unified the electrical\
		part library, PCB standards and workflow with those established for the Medical \
		Exo Team.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;Although My work with suitX went beyond that of an Electrical Engineering\
		Intern, extending to collaborating with the Marketing Team. In addition to weekly\
		interactions with investors and outside partners visiting suitX, I  attended two\
		outreach events one at the Construction Expo and another at Google Ventures\
