		&emsp;SuitX is a startup company working on both medical and industrial Exoskeletons. \
		The company was spun off of Homayoon Kazerooni\'s lab at UC Berkeley.\
		<p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;While competing in the Robotis For Good Competition in Dubai, with the\
		wheelchair project, I met several members of suitX another team competing\
		Afer getting to know them over the course of the competition I ended up going\
		down to Berkeley to intern with them for the summer. During my time there I\
		had the chance to work with their medical, industrial\
		and marketing teams.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;While working with the Medical Exo Team over the four months I was at suitX I\
		updated, modified or designed all thirteen boards on the suit, resulting in\
		a new run of PCBs and a new Exo Suit Revision. I also unified the\
		electrical parts library, established design standards and practices and added\
		revision control.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;During my time working with the Industrial Engineering Team I helped review \
		and update electrical designs going into production. I also unified the electrical\
		part library, PCB standards and workflow with those established for the Medical \
		Exo Team.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
		&emsp;Although I was hired on as an Electical Engineering Intern, I ended up doing\
		working with the marketing team. During my time at suitX I attended two events\
		the first was a contruction exo and the second was at Google Ventures.\
