											&emsp;Go Baby Go is a national, community-based research,\
											design and outreach program that provides modified ride-on\
											cars to children birth to age 3 who experience limited mobility.\
											The program began in 2012 with founder Cole Galloway at the\
											University of Delaware. Integrating assistive technology,\
											families, clinicians and industry partners, the program provides\
											children with disability the opportunity for movement,\
											mobility and socialization and has been expanding ever since.\
										</p>\
										<p>\
											&emsp;The systems orginally only provided a simple button for\
											turning on and off the motor but no way to tack usage. Working\
											with the Oregon State Go Baby Go Project and members of the \
											Personal Robotics Group, designed and implemented add on to\
											the current kit tracking overall usage. Having this tracking\
											data not only helps the researchers but also the users, showing\
											powered mobility will hopefully make a case for a full time chair\
											through insurance. More features and simpler integration is currently being developed\
