			&emsp;Project Chiron is a Self Driving Wheelchair being developed for people with severe\
			physical disabilities at the Oregon State University Personal Robotics Group.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
			&emsp;The project was started with the goal of creating a low cost ($500-$1500) add-on kit for\
			a standard power wheelchair that allowed self driving capabilities. While the\
			system does only cost $1000 (without sensors). The current cost of high quality\
			sensors along with the complexities of navigation in an unknown environment and\
			minimal room for error makes a low cost kit not currently possible. Instead\
			we have focused on what can be accomplished now that there is a computer on board\
			with sensors, location and navigation. Including learning a users driving style.\
			home automation integration and augmenting user driving to make it safer.\
