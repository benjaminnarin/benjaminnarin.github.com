			&emsp;Project Chiron is a Self Driving Wheelchair being developed for people with severe\
			physical disabilities at the Oregon State Universtiy Personal Robotics Group.\
		</p>\
		<p>\
			&emsp;The project was started with the goal of creating a low cost addon kit for\
			a standard power wheelchair that allowed self driving capabilities. While the\
			system approximatly $1000 (without sensors) the current cost of high quality\
			sensors along with the complexities of navigation in an unknown enviorment and\
			minimal room for error makes deploying a system on someones chair dangerous. Instead\
			we have been focusing on what can be accomplished now that there is a computer on board\
			with sensors, location and navigaion.\
