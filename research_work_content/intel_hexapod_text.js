											&emsp;The Intel Hexapod project was a project I worked on my\
											Senior year at Oregon State University. The goal of the project\
											was to integrate the Intel Hexapods running a custom control\
											board, dynamixel servos and an Edison with ROS. Unfortunately\
											due to problems	with the size onboard memory and development tools I spent\
											much of my time working on tool development rather than ROS\
											integration.\
										</p>\
										<p>\
											&emsp;Since the Edison was released many newer System\
											On Chip (SOC) Boards have come out and would be great\
											for this project. Boards such as the joule or upboard would have\
											the needed I/O along with the onboard storage to install\
											everything required. I hope that further integration with these\
											newer more complete systems is integrated in the future.\
