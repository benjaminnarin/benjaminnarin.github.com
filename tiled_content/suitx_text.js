			&emsp;The Phoenix exoskeleton is the world\'s lightest and most advanced exoskeleton designed to help people with mobility disorders to be upright and mobile.\
			In the clinic, at home, and in the workplace Phoenix has successfully enabled many individuals to stand up, walk about, and speak to peers eye-to-eye.\
			Phoenix has only two actuators at its hip; the knee joints are designed to allow support during stance and ground clearance during swing.\
